imagerExtra 1.3.2 was released.

You can install imagerExtra 1.3.2 from CRAN. 

imagerExtra 1.3.1 was removed because imagerExtra 1.3.1 violated CRAN policy.

I modified imagerExtra so as not to violate CRAN policy.

That's why CRAN team accepted imagerExtra 1.3.2.

I apologize to Professor Ripley and the CRAN team for the extra work.
