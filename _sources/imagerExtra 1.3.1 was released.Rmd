imagerExtra 1.3.1 was released.
You can install imagerExtra 1.3.1 from CRAN. 

This is a bug fix release.

Installation of imagerExtra had failed on Solaris.

This is because tesseract isn't available on Solaris.

I modified the example of OCR and the vignette "Optical Character Recognition with imagerExtara" not to use OCR function and OCR_data function on Solaris.

Now, installation has succeeded on Solaris.
